# Nabeeh-System
Capstone Project at Data Science and AI Bootcamp at SDAIA
This project implements a real-time traffic accident detection system using advanced computer vision techniques, particularly leveraging YOLO models. The system aims to improve traffic safety and efficiency by detecting accidents in real time and providing alerts to nearby drivers through dynamic signage.

## Project Overview
This project is focused on enhancing road safety by analyzing video streams from traffic cameras to detect traffic incidents. Upon detecting an accident, the system triggers a digital display to warn drivers, suggesting alternative routes, providing traffic density information, and estimating wait times.
